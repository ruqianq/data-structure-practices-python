**NOTES**

Two concepts: 1. Visiting a vertex; 2. Exploration of a vertex

Breadth First Search: visiting -> exploration, when completely explored (no adjection vertex) then move to next 
adjection node for visiting and utilized queue

Depth First Search: visiting -> exploring, then visit the new one keep exploring, leave the unvisited adjection vertex 
and utilize stack
