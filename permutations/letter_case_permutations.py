# Another approach is to use a string slate to store the current permutation. This avoids creating new strings on every recursive call and eliminates the need to store all permutations at once.
# Instead of creating a new string slate at every step in the recursion, you can modify the string in-place using a list. This avoids building new strings on every recursive call. Additionally, you can avoid storing all permutations at once by yielding results one at a time using a generator.
# This approach reduces auxiliary space by removing the need for constructing new strings at each recursive level and eliminates the need to store all results in memory simultaneously.
# Hereâ€™s how you could implement it:
# this is often can do with permutations problem, but not in combination problem.
